                                                                and provides additional security for the loan which ultimately reduces the overall risk. We tend to put these in place when the loan is riskier than those of our typical loan

                                                            There are many reasons. We all know how stringent, time-consuming and costly the process can be with conventional lenders. Getting to a “yes” or “no” can be tedious and borrowers
                                                            often face last-minute demand from lenders that need to be fulfilled. At AR Financial, we are streamlined, efficient and clear in our approach. We can overcome obstacles, whether
                                                            property or borrower, with creative structuring that banks and other conventional lenders simply can’t or won’t do. We focus on the sponsor and the property to clearly assess the
                                                            merits of each transaction and aren’t saddled by lengthy credit approval processes or all-too-common bank regulations. We also know that not all properties are “ready for prime
                                                            time” due to certain factors. For example, a property may be transitioning or going through lease-up and not be ready for conventional financing. An Anderson Roberts loan works
                                                            well in those cases.

                                                            Funds active in the private lending market commingle the capital of investors into an investment vehicle and make loans according to pre-agreed parameters. Investors in funds have
                                                            little or no say in specific loans their money is used to fund. Plus, smaller funds have administrative costs that at times can significantly reduce investor returns. Our program
                                                            allows you to choose the specific loans in which you invest. With that, you can better define your “risk/return” profile for your particular investment portfolio. For example,
                                                            certain investors prefer lower yielding first liens over higher yielding subordinate liens. Having your choice in loans, you have control in how you shape your investment portfolio
                                                            over time.

                                                            the lender group is clearly spelled out in our proprietary ‘Co-Lender Agreement’ that is signed by all investors in a particular loan. You have direct access to any material

                                                            Occasionally, we provide A/B loan structures to our borrowers. This entails placing two liens (A and B) on the subject property at the same time. A-notes represent the senior lien
                                                            and B-notes represent the junior lien. Investors in the A-note are in a safer position of the security and therefore receive a yield commensurate to that risk profile. Investors in
                                                            the B-note are in a perceived riskier position and therefore are paid a higher yield commensurate with their risk level.

                                                                usually when we have prior experience with the borrower.
